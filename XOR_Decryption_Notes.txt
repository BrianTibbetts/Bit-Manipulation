XOR Encryption Method
-To encrypt, take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII codes, then XOR each byte with a given value taken from a secret key.
-The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text restores the plain text. For example, if the key is 42...
    Plain text to cipher text: 65 XOR 42 = 107
    Cipher text to plain text: 107 XOR 42 = 65
-For unbreakable encryption, the key must be the same length as the plain text message. That is impractical compared to using a shorter password as the key.
-If the key is shorter than the plain text, then the key will be repeated cyclically throughout the cipher text.

Strategy for Decrypting the Cipher Text
-There are 17576 (26*26*26) possible keys, a low enough number for brute force to be an option.
-XOR encryption has similar flaws to a Vigen√®re cipher. Since the key is known to be 3 characters, the cipher text can be separated into 3 columns to decrypt individually.
    For example, character 1 of the key was used to encrypt characters 1, 4, 7, ..., N-2, where N is the length of the cipher text.
-Since the plain text is in English, use frequency analysis. Each character of the key which produces the most 'e' characters is most likely part of the decryption key.
